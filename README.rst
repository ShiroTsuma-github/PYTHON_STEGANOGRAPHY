Python Steganography Project
==================================


This Python project aims to implement steganography techniques to hide encoded messages within images. Steganography is the art and science of concealing information 
within other non-secret data to avoid detection. In this case, we'll be hiding messages within image files.

Getting Started 
---------------

Our objective was to create interesting solution for hiding messages that no one is able to see. Interesting about this project is a implementation, 
message you want to hide is coded 2 times. Firstly, app is coding your message as different characters, then it's coded in image.

Usage
-----

App that codes messages in images can be useful when you want exchange messages with your friend like in action films. We can use it in situations where we're not
sure about communicator we're using with friends and want test it if it's not stealing our data. We can also store our private notes without fear of someone seeing it.
Some may use the app to create artistic works where the message is hidden in the content of the image. This can be an interesting application for people who like
to combine art with technology. It is important to note that while such an app can be used for a variety of purposes, there is also potential for inappropriate or 
illegal use, such as concealing unethical or criminal activities. Always use technology responsibly and legally.

Features
--------
With this app you can: 
   - hide message which include all special characters you have on keyboard and all letters in polish language
   - hide message up to 1000 characters for image with 100 x 100 resolution
   - saving message only in image with .png ( with no transperency ) extension, jpg and jpeg are non lossless format so using them is pointless
   - generate coding key which is 31 character long and have hexadecimal numbers or try your own key ( minimum 10 char length, less than that can produce errors ) 
   - all of options above are packed into one minimalistic window application which is nice for your eye
   - only one .exe 

Installation
------------

To use this steganography tool, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system in case of running main.py. .exe is provided in dist and it doesn't need anything.
Clone this repository and install the required dependencies 
using the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/ShiroTsuma-github/PYTHON_STEGANOGRAPHY.git
   cd PYTHON_STEGANOGRAPHY
   pip install -r requirements.txt 

Examples
--------

Coding message "I love programming" in image with png extension with auto generated key 

.. image:: /resources/images/encoding_example.png

Decoding message "I love programming" from coded image with png extension with earlier generated key

.. image:: /resources/images/decoding_example.png
